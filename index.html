            <p>
              The idea of this project came when I was organizing the store room in my house and realised how
              cumbersome it was to keep track of the items. The frontend is written with Typescript and React, backend
              is built with Express which is also in Typescript. Database is Postgres and Sequelize is used as the
              ORM, the project is also using Sqitch to manage database migrations. Docker and docker compose for
              development. Developing in Typescript takes much longer than in Javascript but I feel that the benefits
              far outweighs the costs, especially when you are developing a production level project. It helps you
              spot silly or potential bugs beforehand and also gives you a nice autocomplete.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people would have most likely went for MongoDB instead of Postgres to complete the "MERN" stack but
              in this case, the data columns are already known beforehand so using an SQL based database makes sense.
              The project is also using AWS S3 to store images, the user uploads the image to S3 and S3 returns the
              key which we would then store in the database. As for authentication, I decided to use Auth0 as I
              believe outsourcing authentication to a third party service provider is safer than building our own
              authentication system, especially when there is time constraints. These third party authentication
              providers have a system that is well tested and will often be more superior than what most developers
              can build. On to deployment, the frontend is deployed on Netlify for ease and backend is deployed on
              Heroku.

            <h5>Features</h5>
            <p>
              A user can sign up and create a collection. There are no limit to how
              many collections can a user have. Each collection contains a set of inventories, there is also no limit
              to how many inventories can be created. Users are also able to create categories and status for
              inventories, these can be used for filtering. The inventories are displayed in a data table that is
              capable of sorting by name or creation date, filtering can be done by search, quantity, serial number,
              category, or status. Users can also select multiple inventories for bulk delete. They can also update
              the details of each inventory.
            </p>

            <h5>Improvements</h5>
            <p>
              There are certainly things that can be improved. First is improving security, right now, if user "A"
              knows the collection ID of user "B", they would be able to perform API calls on behalf of user "B".
              There are two ways we can address this, use Auth0 permissions, or encrypt the collection ID before
              passing to the client. Another way to improve security is to track the user's activity, doing this
              allows us to better audit the user's data in the event something goes wrong. Other issues to fix
              includes implementing pagination as well as form validation on the client side. The platform will be
              production ready when these improvements are implemented.
